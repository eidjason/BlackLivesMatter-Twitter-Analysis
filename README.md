## BlackLivesMatter Social Media Analytics

### Project Description

In July 2013, the Black Lives Matter movement began following the acquittal
of George Zimmerman after he shot a black teenager Trayvon Martin.
Since then, **Twitter** has become the key platform for this movement: people use it to
reach thousands of people rapidly and spread information about protests, victims,
updates about cases, and so on. </br> </br>

In December 2020, it would be interesting to see if hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #BLM still have
the same prominence they had between May and July of 2020. </br> </br>

These are some of the questions that one can ask about this topic: </br>

What have people been saying about BLM? How do people feel about it? </br>
What is the relation between the tweets and the events happening? </br>
What was being said about the movement? </br>
Is the majority of the tweets toxic or not? </br>

### Project Objectives
1. Collecting data from twitter using tweepy, on different occasions.
2. Storing data in json files.
3. Preprocessing and cleaning data for sensitivity analysis.
4. Using Google Perpective API to predict the toxicity of tweets.
5. Inserting the data in MySQL database.
6. To answer some questions: Establishing a connection to MySQL database and performing queries.
7. Visualizing query results.
